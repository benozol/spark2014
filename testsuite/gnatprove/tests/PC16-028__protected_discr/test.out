prot.adb:10:24: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Val + X (e.g. when X = -1) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at prot.ads:7 should mention X in a precondition]
