p.adb:10:31: info: range check proved (CVC4: 2 VC)
p.adb:11:31: high: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for V-1 (e.g. when V = 25) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: input value must fit in parameter type] [possible fix: add precondition (V >= T'First + 1) to subprogram at line 7]
