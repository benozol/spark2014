account1.adb:15:39: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Num_Accounts + 1
   15 |         Num_Accounts := Num_Accounts + 1;
      |                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
  e.g. when Num_Accounts = Natural'Last
  (the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak)
  reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer
  possible fix: loop at line 13 should mention Num_Accounts in a loop invariant
   13 |      loop
      |      ^ here
