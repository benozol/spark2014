p.adb:9:35: high: range check might fail (e.g. when Int1 = 0 and TC_Last = 11) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: slice bounds must fit in the underlying array] [possible fix: subprogram at p.ads:3 should mention TC_Items and TC_Last in a precondition]
p.adb:9:57: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array]
p.ads:3:15: warning: subprogram "Proc" has no effect
