pack.adb:7:27: high: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Pocket + S (e.g. when Pocket = 1000000000 and S = 1/100) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: result of fixed-point addition must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at pack.ads:17 should mention Pocket]
