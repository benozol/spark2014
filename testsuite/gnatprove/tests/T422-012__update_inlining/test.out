update.adb:8:33: high: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for V (e.g. when V = 0) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: value must fit in component type] [possible fix: add precondition (V in Positive) to subprogram at line 6]
