pack.adb:4:14: info: add a contract to analyze it separately from calling contexts
pack.adb:4:14: info: local subprogram "Q" only analyzed in the context of calls
pack.adb:6:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1, in call inlined at pack.adb:12 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at pack.ads:4 should mention X in a precondition]
