eval.ads:7:42: high: array index check might fail (e.g. when A'First = 0 and A'Last = -1 and J = -1) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array] [possible explanation: enclosing 'Old attribute reference is unconditionally evaluated on subprogram entry] [possible fix: add precondition (J in Integer) to subprogram at line 6]
