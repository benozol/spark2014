exprfun.ads:3:55: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X / Y (e.g. when X = -1 and Y = 0) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: result of division must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (X / Y in Integer) to subprogram at line 3]
