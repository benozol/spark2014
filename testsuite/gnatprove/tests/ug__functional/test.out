functional.ads:31:14: high: postcondition might fail, cannot prove Max_Value_Seen /= (Second_Max_Value_Seen)
   31 |             Max_Value_Seen /= Second_Max_Value_Seen;
      |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  e.g. when Max1 = 1
        and Max2 = 1
  (the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak)
