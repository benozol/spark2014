choice.adb:4:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Y + 1 (e.g. when Y = Integer'Last) [the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak] [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention Y in a precondition]
