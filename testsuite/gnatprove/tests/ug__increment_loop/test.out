    4 |  Post => X = X'Old + N
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  possible fix: loop at line 7 should mention X in a loop invariant
    7 |   for I in 1 .. N loop
      |                   ^ here

increment_loop.adb:8:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1
    8 |      X := X + 1;
      |           ~~^~~
  e.g. when X = Integer'Last
  (the code does not conform to the check, or some loop invariant or post condition is too weak)
  reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer
  possible fix: loop at line 7 should mention X in a loop invariant
    7 |   for I in 1 .. N loop
